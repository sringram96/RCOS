The Open Source project that I am most interested in working on is a project sponsored by RCOS. 
The project is titles, LATE. I believe LATe can be a very used piece of software eventually. It's in its early stages so I can ge tin "on the ground floor" so to speak. Although it soudns abitious. 
I always thought that an RPG style event scheduler would help a lot of people with motivation problems. 
The open source application called Habitica tries to tackle this very issue the same way and I believe LATE has a place married to this open source software RPG.
