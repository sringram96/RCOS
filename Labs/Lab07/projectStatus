For this project, I will need to learn a lot before actually contributing meaningful code.
The language Rust is not something I have ever used before so that will be my first step, learning rust.
I have been told the learning curve is steep for rust but it cnanot be worse than haskell or scheme or any of the other
languages I have had to learn in a hsort period of time so I a very excited to get started learning it.
