Lab 09 has to do with docker containers and virtualization.

I have had formal training in docker and Kubernetes with my internship so this is not new information forme, still it was good to refr
refresh my memory on some of the syntax things associated with Docker.

## Part 0

Part 0 involved  installing Docker and verifyng installation so  nothing special here

## Part 1
n ext part introduced how to open a bash shell in a docker container and use it like a terminal, this is how i normally use docker 
because its like having a lightweight virtual computer. My only issue is that it can't save files so that's a problem
still very cool to learn about the cowsay function

## Part 2
Part 2 gets more involved in running multiple docker containers and having them communicate with each other. 
This one was a little difficult for me ecause I used the google cloud platform to code this lab
But I believe my pictures are sufficient enough evidence to see I got it working

## Part 3
Part 3 discussed how to build your own docker container again but mentions an extremely important keyword in dockerfiles ADD
This is  a  cool function that allows you to take files on your filesystem and add them to you docker container
in any directory you want

## Part 4
This is where boys become men, the docker-comopose file
When I learned docker in my internship docker-compose was really the bread and butter of docker. Wtih a .yaml file
you can spawn multiple containers that talk to each other and you can feed it a bunch of information about each other to coordinate them
this is how i launch my LAMP stacks when i want to debug the websites I work on
