Gitstats does an excellent job of showing change over time, as
opposed to handwriting observations, which is tedious even only
taking specific moments (like first and most recent commit)

- contributers 3
- LOC 103388
- First: Initial commit
- Latest: template init
- branches:
	- master
	- gh-pages
- git stats
	- the total LOC found is less that wc found probably because it doesnt incluse whitespace
	- they also say 4 authors instead of the 3 github said on the top bar there may be an author with only commits in another branch
