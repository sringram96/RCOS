Lab 08 was about testing and different open source testing helpers
Lab 08 was particularly difficult for me because of windows but I still made it work

## Part 1
Part 1 was simply installing and verifying the installation of the VTK, this was actually the hardest part as funny as it sounds

## Part 2
checkpoint two is just exeuting tests on the vtk testing system, simple enough

## Part 3
checkpoint 3 is to break the test! this is the best part, i break things regularly so this was no problem for me

## Part 4
checkpoint 4 was to fix the test we broke, this sounded much harder than it was, because the only thing that was wrong was  a single word
on a single line in an assert statement. Nothing particularly crazy but it demonstrates how the VTK open source project works very well
