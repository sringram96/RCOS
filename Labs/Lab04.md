It is important to choose a lisence for your open source project because otherwise  it is not free for 
people to use. The differing liscences have different pros and cons but wihtout any liscence your code will not be "open source"
by definition.
# ii
You shouldn't use software that does not have an open source liscence because it would violate the rights of the user who created the codebase.
It isunethical and will get flagged in submitty and you will be charged with academic dishonesty (or the legal equivalent which is probably much less pleasent)..

I do agree with the claim that code, that is intended to be open sourced eventually, should be open sourced early on in development.
The advantage of this model is having software that has a large gathering that is established in the projects infancy. This allows a ocmmunity
to gather and vest themselves in the projects success.

The reason Microsoft made .NET Core open source, and the reason theyve spent a lot of time and resources to expand the Net Core libraries
is because Microsoft has been osing a lot of ground in the server side market to Linux. In a bid to gain more market share, they made .NEt Core open sourced
and they even expanded their grasp on linux distros with WSL. They are tryin got appeal to the linux crowd. Simple Business. https://opensource.com/business/14/11/microsoft-dot-net-empower-open-source-communities

As a group we decided to examine the open source project Open Circuits, We decided a good liscence would be BDS3.

For a developer I believe that GPL would be the best, This is ebcasue it allows the most collaboration on the project while also 
relieveing yourself of the liability for the product.
For a business, Apache is better because this lisence allows them to make their project open source but also allows them to put their name and logo on the software.
For hte greater good lgpl because it is like gpl but less restictive.

When choosing a project to work on , I would want it to be widely used and helpful. The RCOS project LATE falls into both of these categories. THe users would be average people who need help organizing their life, like me. If it works I would use an apache lisence because it would take a lot of work to make and I believe credit is due to the authors of the project.
