Lab10 is all about MongoDB. I have never used MongoDb before but have some familiarity with open source, noSQL databases
specifically Couchbase. I designed an ETL tool to translate SQL tables to JSON to put into Couchbase

## Part 1
part 1 is just downloading and installation. Important to install the bin and not build the whole project from source

## Part 2
Part 2 is just loading data into the database, again this was a little difficult but only because i am just starting to
understand how this program functions by this point

## Part 3
Part 3 is where we start to get to the meat ofno-SQL, Running basic querys and looking at the results

## Part 4
Part 4 is where we see how seamlessly python integrates with mongodb, which im sure is the reason a ton of 
start ups use mongodb but im just speculating

## Part 5 is us developing a new python function to take random samples of the database and add timestamps to them to show
when we viewed the data
