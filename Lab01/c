The readings presented in this lab were very interesting and informative.
The open soruce definition article really gave come concrete vocabulary for me to use
when defining what open source technology is. Lately, open source has been sort of a buzz word for me. 
Switching into this class is a way for me to explore the subject and expand my knowledge. 
I especially like how anti-discrimination is very important to open source developers. 
How to ask a question the smart way is my favorite article. I agree 100% with what the article is saying. 
Sometimes, especially early in my comuter science career, I asked questions very persistently, but if I had searched for the answer myself I would've found the answer very easily. 
Sometimes I would have a hard time finding the answer because I didn't fully understand the question I was asking. 
Improving this area in my mind helped me pursue my computer science career further. 
2 ways I would answer questions in a more helpful way is to not sound accusatory. 
Don't make the person your helping feel bad for not understanding, they're trying to learn, and asking questions is a natural part of learning. Another way I would answer questions ore helpfully is to usee analogies. 
I find its best to explain complicated subjects to other people using simple abstract examples or relating it to something that it much simpiler.
